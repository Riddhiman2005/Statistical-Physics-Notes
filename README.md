# Statistical Physics Notes # 


Statistical physics is a branch of physics that aims to understand the behavior of physical systems composed of a large number of particles, such as atoms or molecules. It provides a framework for describing the collective properties and dynamics of these systems by using statistical methods.
Statistical physics has applications in various areas of physics, chemistry, biology, and beyond. It is used to study phenomena like phase transitions, critical phenomena, quantum gases, and the behavior of complex systems such as fluids and materials.

Under this Repository, I've uploaded the notes of Statistical Physics on the classes I took in **Everlasting Quest for Physics** classes. Check all the section, the **mathematics od statistical mechanics** folder too
